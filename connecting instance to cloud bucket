jupyter notebook

# gives a link tp put into browser

open new tab in terminal:
ssh -L 8889:localhost:8888 -i ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine tobynbranck@35.231.253.54

##changed 8888 to 8889 because I already had jupyter running locally

paste jupyter link from first tab to browser and change the 8888 to 8889
